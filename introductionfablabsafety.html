                    <p> The Fablab in Singapore Polytechnic has a large number of tools, equipment and machinery which we can use to fabricate our project.
                         As part of this module we would need to use the Fablab for our projects and thus we will be taught on how to operate the different
                         machinery, tools and equipments </p>
